<li>My new project 'LanguageVio' is actually a language learning website for students. Here we have some classes, instructors, student reviews and some important information. </li>
<li>Here it can execute three types of users like students, instructors and last but not least admins. Base one users type it gives users different routes.</li>
<li>If users enter as an students, he or she can select class and then can pay for that class, and those information will shown to them.</li>
<li>AS an instructor user, he or she can add their class on add a class route and see those info to my classes route.</li>
<li>But if an admin login there, he has the option to make any user admin or instructor. An admin also can approved or denied any class which was added by an instructor.</li>
<li>There is also have an option to create a account here or continue with google.</li>
Here I used some packages like: React Tanstack Query, Axios, React-Hook-From, Stripe, react-swiper and more.
